STM32F469I-Discovery Code
-------------------------

I've got one of these boards from ST Micro and I have been
programming it with libopencm3 (sorry STCube). These are the
examples I've come up with so far.

I thought about suggesting them for the [libopencm3-examples][]
repo but there are already a bunch of examples there and these
are nominally redundant. That might change if I get an SDRAM and
Display example set up however.
