/*
 * sbrk.c
 *
 * This implements a larger heap than you get by default
 * in newlib. It uses the RAM between the end of the declared
 * data and the bottom of the "largest" stack for the heap.
 *
 * The only user interface to this code is the weakly bound
 * local_heap_setup() which is called the first time malloc
 * has to get more memory for the heap. This function passes
 * pointers to its two controls, the start address and end
 * address of the heap. Once called those are not changed.
 *
 * If the user does not define local_heap_setup in their code,
 * the RAM between _ebss and _stack - MAX_STACK_SIZE is used
 * for the heap. Typically this is RAM that is internal to the
 * SoC.
 *
 * On other processors, additional ram might become available
 * after reset and some peripheral setup (like PSRAM or SDRAM
 * on parts with the FMC peripheral). In that case the user
 * can define their own function local_heap_setup and put
 * the start and end address of heap into that external RAM.
 *
 * Note that memory MUST be contiguous between the start and
 * end point of the heap. If there are gaps in that memory
 * then malloc() will hard fault when it tries to use
 * memory from the gap.
