USB Device Example
------------------

This is a bit different, the current USB support in
libopencm3 is in a state of transistion, I was looking
to get a 'by the registers' example done and have
created a single usb\_otg.h file rather than the two
that are currently in the library. 

Its a work in progress and is not yet complete.
