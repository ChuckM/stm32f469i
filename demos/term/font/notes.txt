Font generation
---------------

Clearly we can generate glyphs with existing font files
if we use the freetype library. Now to decide what we
really want to do. Is it to get every glyph inside a
10 x 19 box? We can do that by scaling the font for
glyphs that fall outside that box.

Every glyph that exceeds 9 x 18 gets scaled? (leaves
one pixel between)

Working through the exclamation point issue:

Passed in origin (x, y) => (2, 12)
Cell properties H = 19, W = 10, BL = 5
Glyph size (w, h) => (4, 13)
Glyph box (sx, sy) => (ex, ey) : (2, 30) => (6, 2)
